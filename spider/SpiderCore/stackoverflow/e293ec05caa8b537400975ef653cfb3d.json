  "text":" Trying to return the value of either dy or days Sometimes dy is set other times days is set For example dy value 45 or days value 75 only one value will be set However when I execute this statement the value is always equal to 1 How can I return the actual value of either dy or days days isset dy value isset days value dy value days value null 3 Answers 3 active oldest votes up vote 0 down vote Any particular reason you need a ternary In this case an if elseif would probably be cleaner and easier to read if isset dy value days dy value elseif isset days value days days value If it absolutely must be a ternary you need a ternary within a ternary days isset dy value dy value isset days value days value null If you re using PHP 5 3 which you should be this should work to days dy value days value null share improve this answer answered 11 mins ago Styphon 5 08152144 add a comment up vote 0 down vote I guess This might be what you wanted days isset dy value isset days value isset dy value dy value days value null share answered 8 mins ago santosh433 305 add a comment up vote 0 down vote About 1 In PHP doesn t do what you might expect coming from JavaScript because the result will always be a boolean implicitely converts its operands to booleans and returns the result To get the equivalent of a short circuit from JavaScript in PHP you can use days isset dy value isset days value dy value days value null I didn t change the first because it s indeed a boolean operation but I did replace the second However I think there is a logic error in your code anyway because if you have E NOTICE error reporting on PHP will complain anyway if days value is set and dy value isn t because you are still accessing dy value even if isset dy value false So you would need to use for example days isset dy value dy value null isset days value days value null Assuming you also want to skip a value if it s falsy according to how you are using the it looks like it If you don t care about notice errors at all discouraged you could just use days dy value days value null share improve this answer edited 6 mins ago answered 12 mins ago CherryDT 2 4781528 add a comment Your Answer draft saved draft discarded Sign up or log in Sign up using Google Sign up using Facebook Sign up using Email and Password Post as a guest Name Email Post as a guest Name Email discard By posting your answer you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service Not the answer you re looking for Browse other questions tagged php ternary operator or ask your own question",
